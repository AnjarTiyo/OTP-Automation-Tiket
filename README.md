# Handling OTP Authentication with SMS using TWILIO API

## Description

Here I show how to handle OTP authentication Automation. So, this is scenario where user want to login to [tiket.com](https://www.tiket.com/) using his phone number. But user is prompted to enter OTP sent to his phone number to complete login process. Below is scenario written in BDD style:

```
Feature: Login with OTP

  As an Registered User,
  I want to __login with my credentials__
  In order to **access logged in user feature**

  Scenario: Verify OTP Login functionality
    Given User already on Login Page
    When User enter registered phone number
    And User input OTP
    Then User is logged in
```

I use Twilio SMS API to process SMS and extract OTP Code to complete login flow.


## Pre-requisite

1. Java IDE, I use Intelij
2. An [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) Account and buy a phone number. There is free trial.
